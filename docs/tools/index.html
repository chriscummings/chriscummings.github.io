<p>Every item on this list is in either perfect (never actually used) or good condition 
(with the exception of the miter saw at the end of the list [and some corrosion on the throat plate of the table saw]). </p>
<p>I bought a lot of this at my old house when I had different plans that I never got around to.</p>
<p>These prices aren't set in stone either.</p>

<h1>Ryobi Miter Saw </h1>
(Damaged!!!)<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RF3JXNK">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RF3JXNK</a><br>
This fell off a table and:<br>
-Broke the safety guard off.<br>
-Knocked the blade angle off center by around 1-2mm.<br>
I still used it for quick cuts and could only ever notice that it was off alignment when cutting something bigger than 7-8 inches (of it’s 10 inch max). I’m pretty sure if you’re willing to pull it apart you can bring the blade angle back to 90 degrees, I just never cared for cutting 2x4s.<br>
$40<br>
